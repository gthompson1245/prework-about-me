      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a professional Arborist by trade. I am 28 years old. I started cleaning windows on high-rise buildings in Madison, WI when I was 20 - hanging from buildings I caught the bug - I discovered I liked working on rope. 
        I found myself working in trees two years later where I have been since. 
        Most recently I decided to take a step back from a rewarding yet grueling career in arboriculture in order to pursue a degree in electrical engineering from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. 
       I have been most focused recently on software development in order to round out my skillset and maintain myself as employer competitive as possible. I am from Rockford, IL originally. 
       At 18 I moved to Tahoe City, CA to snowboard and see what life was all about. I moved several more times between Montana, California and Wisconsin until I landed in Nashville, TN where I have been since 2014.

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am most definitely a hobbyist. I have what sometimes seems like 100 hobbies. I am an avid amateur radio operator/listener - my callsign is KN4YIJ - 
        My knowledge is evolving every day as I explore the countless aspects of the hobby - it is rich, rewarding and challenging. 
        I am often surrounded by much more experienced operators and their (your!) knowledge is what drives me to keep exploring. 73! My favorite thing to do is ride my Yamaha YZ450F at full throttle (off road) - 
        I love speed, I love adrenaline and I enjoy sitting back after a good day and building electronics or getting out in the trees to improve my antenna any way I can - it has been an interesting process. 
        Currently, I have an inverted v suspended in space between the house and an Eastern Red Cedar tree. 
        The apex is at 28' with 53' bare wire legs at approx. 130deg - 25ft of window-line straight to an air core balun of coax to the antenna tuner inside a Xiegu G90 transceiver. According to my measurements - the antenna is nearly.. good. 
        I have hit Toronto on 8 watts. So you be the judge. 
        As I move forward in the hobby I intend on exploring other antenna systems, transceivers, linear amps etc. I enjoy working with my hands and my mind. I build Arduino widgets whenever I discover a need - no matter how silly. 
        I enjoy IoT and network integration. When in the garage, I'm either welding something, honing my technique or wrenching on a motorcycle.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to produce industrial products. Whether thats circuit development or industry leading web pages - 
        I am constantly seeking new avenues in order to discover just what my dream job truly is.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Bellevue, TN where I have a home at the end of a cul-de-sac. I have wonderful neighbors and they put up with me. I have two dogs and am engaged to my beautiful wife-to-be Lauren.
      </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Being a web developer, to me, means being someone who has a full-stack skill set. I want to push the boundaries of 
        the very definition of 'full-stack' - I crave critical thinking situations and opportunity for understanding. 
        Thats something where web development has much to offer.
