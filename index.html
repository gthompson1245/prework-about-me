      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a profession Arborist by trade. I have decided to take a step back from a rewarding yet grueling career in tree service in order to persue
        a degree in Engineering. I am focusing on software development in order to round out my skillset and maintain 
        myself as employer cempetitive as possible. 
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Rockford, IL originally. At 18 I moved to Tahoe City, CA to snowboard and see what life was all about. 
        I moved several more times between Montana, California and Wisconsin until I landed in Nashville, TN where I have been since 2014.

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am most definitely a hobbyist. I have what sometimes seems like 100 hobbies.
        I am an avid HAM radio operator - my callsign is KN4YIJ
        My favorite thing to do is ride my Yamaha YZ450F at full throttle - I love speed, I love adrenaline and I enjoy sitting back
        after a good day and making contacts across the United States on the HAM radio bands.
        I enjoy working with my hands and my mind. I build Arduino widgets whenever I discover a need - no matter how silly. I enjoy IoT 
        and network integration. When in the garage, I'm either welding something, honing my technique or wrenching on a motorcycle.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to produce industrial products. Whether thats circuit development or industry leading web pages - I am constantly seeking new avenues
        in order to discover just what my dream job truly is.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Bellevue, TN where I have a home at the end of a couldesac. I have wonderful neighbors and they put up with me.
        I have two dogs and am engaged to my beautiful wife-to-be Lauren.
      </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Being a web developer, to me, means being someone who has a full-stack skill set. I want to push the bounderies of 
        the very definition of 'full-stack' - I crave critical thinking situations and opportunity for thorough understanding 
        Thats something where web development has much to offer.
